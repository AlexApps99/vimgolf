** Game Excersizes

** Browser
*** Handle/fix character encoding
    Things like &lt; and &gt;, etc.
*** Fix line endings
    Need to convert ^M characters
*** Add/fix line wrapping
    Can't assume that everyone's emacs will be set the same. Should really set a
    particular fill-column and enforce it.
*** Truncate long titles
    Use ellipses to truncate titles that would normally be longer than the
    fill-column width.
